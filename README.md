# Image-Denoising-VLG-2024
Image Denoising using ResNet

I’ve run the model three times and got PSNR1 as 23.87, PSNR2 as 23.72 and 
PSNR3 as 22.4. Now we’ll be taking average of these values. 
FINAL PSNR = 23.66 
To further improve this project I would suggest using FFDNet but it takes a lot 
of RAM and VRAM and is very computationally stressing, so I used ResNet. 
Further details are given in report file.
THANK YOU!!!
